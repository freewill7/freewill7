We store your results and preferences in a [Firebase Cloud Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) instance using industry and platform best practices. The data does not contain any personal information and can be deleted at any time by using the “Delete Everything” functionality found in the “Settings” section of the app.

When using the app you will be prompted to identify yourself using an e-mail address- we do not retain or use this e-mail address for any other purpose. The identification process allows us to ensure that only you are able to access and update your app data.
